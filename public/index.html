        <h1>Stop Snoozing Your Future</h1>

        <p>Gone are the days where relying on the government or a company for financial security is a sustainable option.</p>
        <p>Most sense this to be the case but many, myself included, have been unwilling to act along this new axiom of truth.</p>
        <p><strong>What's holding back action?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fear of financial insecurity:</strong>Having a good job and a career has been the main way for people to pay for their lives.  More and more people require more than one job just to make ends meet with very little left over for saving for the future.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fear of the Unkown:</strong>Conquer the fear of learning new skills, highlighting how embracing change can lead to growth.</li>

            <li><strong>Fear of Dependency:</strong> True independence requires breaking free from what society says is ok including substances, social validation, or outdated lifestyle norms. Redirecting time and resources from such dependencies can fuel growth and financial autonomy.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fear of Isolation:</strong> Building connections with individuals who support each other's journey is crucial to a feeling of personal attainment.
    </ul>
